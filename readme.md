Welcome to the most CHAOTIC, GAMBLING-BASED, SHIT-QUALITY image hosting service that has ever cursed the internet! üî•üíÄ

## üé≤ What the FUCK is this?

### üé∞ The Gambling System

- **50%** üçÄ - LUCKY BASTARD! Your image survives unharmed
- **25%** üí© - NORMAL SHITTIFICATION! Moderate quality destruction  
- **25%** üíÄ - EXTREME NUCLEAR ANNIHILATION! Complete image genocide

## üöÄ Features

- ‚ú® **CHAOS-DRIVEN DESIGN** - Frontend that looks like it was designed by drunk hamsters
- üé∞ **GAMBLING MECHANICS** - Because who doesn't want to gamble with their photos?
- üí© **PROFESSIONAL SHIT QUALITY** - Using cutting-edge image destruction technology
- üî• **COMIC SANS EVERYWHERE** - The superior font choice
- üåà **SEIZURE-SAFE ANIMATIONS** - We're chaotic but not murderous
- üíÄ **UUID-BASED STORAGE** - Because we're not COMPLETE amateurs
- üé≤ **TRIPLE-PASS DESTRUCTION** - For when you REALLY want to destroy an image

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

```bash
# Clone this beautiful disaster
git clone https://github.com/tovade/pissandshitimages.git

# Enter the realm of chaos
cd pissandshitimages

# Install the dependencies of doom
npm install

# Create your .env file (don't fucking commit this)
echo "SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url_here" > .env
echo "SUPABASE_KEY=your_supabase_key_here" >> .env

# Start the chaos engine
npm start
```

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Setup

Run this SQL in your Supabase or whatever database you're using:

```sql
-- Mom i want the db schemas
-- okay sweetie here it is
CREATE TABLE images (
    id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    data text NOT NULL,
    mimetype text NOT NULL
);

CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS "pgcrypto";
-- Thank you mom
-- no problem sweetie
```

## üé® Technology Stack

- **Express.js** - For serving this beautiful disaster
- **Sharp** - For professional image destruction
- **Supabase** - Database that somehow tolerates our chaos
- **Multer** - File upload handling
- **Comic Sans MS** - The only font that matters
- **Pure Chaos Energy** - Our secret ingredient

## üìñ API Documentation

### `POST /upload`
Uploads an image and subjects it to the GAMBLING GODS

**Request:**
- `multipart/form-data` with `image` field

### `GET /i/:id/raw`

## üéØ How the Shittification Works

### Normal Shittification (25% chance):
1. Resize to 400x300 max
2. Apply aggressive blur
3. Median filter for that 90s GIF look
4. JPEG compression at quality 3
5. Double compression at quality 2
6. Color/gamma fuckery

### EXTREME NUCLEAR DESTRUCTION (25% chance):
1. **TRIPLE-PASS DESTRUCTION**
2. Progressive size reduction (300‚Üí250‚Üí200 pixels)
3. Increasing blur each pass
4. Color saturation abuse
5. Over-sharpening for artifacts
6. JPEG quality goes from 5‚Üí4‚Üí3‚Üí2‚Üí1
7. Nearest-neighbor scaling for maximum pixels

## ü§ù Contributing

Want to make this even MORE chaotic? Here's how:

1. Fork this beautiful disaster
2. Create a branch with a ridiculous name
3. Add more chaos
4. Make sure your code is as shitty as possible
5. Submit a PR with excessive emojis

**Contribution Guidelines:**
- All code must be commented with absolute gibberish
- Use Comic Sans in your editor if possible
- Add more gambling mechanics
- More emoji = better code
- If it doesn't make someone question their life choices, it's not chaotic enough
